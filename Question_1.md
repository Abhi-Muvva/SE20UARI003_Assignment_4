# Which metric is more important, precision or recall? Give a reason to your answer (consider NASA Remaining Useful Life Problem)

### The cost of a failure is extremely high. The failure of a turbofan engine can lead to a catastrophic loss of life and property. Therefore, it is essential to avoid any false negatives, i.e., cases where the model predicts that the engine is safe to operate when it is actually failing.
### The formula for recall is: 
> _True Positive/True Positive + False Negative_.
### Precision and recall are both important metrics for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model on a classification task. However, in the context of the NASA RUL problem for turbojets, recall is considered to be the more important metric.
### In the case of this problem, a true positive is a component that is correctly predicted to fail within a certain time period. Recall is important because it ensures that the model is able to identify all of the components that are at risk of failure.
### A predicted positive is a component that is predicted to fail within a certain time period, regardless of whether it actually does fail. Precision is important because it ensures that the model is not generating too many false positives.
### In the context of the NASA RUL problem, it is more important to have a high recall than high precision. Due to the fact that it is more important to identify all components that are at risk of failure, even if it means generating some false positives. False positives can be dealt by performing additional inspections or maintenance on the components. However, if a true positive is missed, it could lead to a catastrophic failure.
### For example, consider a machine learning model that is used to predict the RUL of aircraft engines. The model has a recall of 90% and a precision of 80%. This means that the model correctly identifies 90% of the engines that are at risk of failure, but it also generates 20% false positives.
### In this hypothetical situation, the model is still very useful, even though precision is not apt. The false positives can be dealt with, by performing additional inspections on engines. However, if the model had low recall, it would miss some of the engines that are at risk of failure, which could lead to serious accidents.
### Finally, there are always trade-offs between precision and recall. It is possible to increase the recall of a model by decreasing the precision and vice versa. However, in this context, recall is generally considered to be the more important metric.
